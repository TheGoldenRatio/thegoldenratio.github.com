<h3 id="first-and-foremost-a-disclaimer">First and foremost, a disclaimer.</h3>
<p>I’ve heard people say that social media serves as a reflection for our current (and often aspirational) conceptions of self. I think that writing and blogging (esp. about yourself) has a similar function. As such, this blog will constantly evolve as I think of weird things to post and then cringe later on. The probability is high that many things will make no sense because I enjoy extremely extended, convoluted inside jokes. I realize that some people do not. Sorry.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-about-me">A bit about me.</h3>
<p>I’m Jonathan Chang, a recent Yale University grad (HC/FFKACC ‘16). I was a double major in political science and mechanical engineering because I’m interested in everything and often pretty indecisive. I’m currently into international politics and development, entrepreneurship, data, and design. I love art, Carleen, the <a href="http://consortium.pw">Consortium</a>, crosswords, good infographics, museums, orange(s), pretending to be a weightlifter, reading, my suitemates, traveling, UCA people, and UCW, in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>I’m currently living in Kyrgyzstan which honestly has been one of the most enjoyable and meaningful things I’ve done in my (so far, short) life. 10/10 would recommend just moving to a place you know nothing about if the chance ever comes up.</p>

<h3 id="building-this-blog">Building this blog.</h3>
<p>This blog is a work in progress and was created with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby static site generator. I highly recommend it cause it’s pretty simple and freely hosted on Github.</p>
