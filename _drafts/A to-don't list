things not to do:
- watch sports
- watch TV programs with ads
- worry about saving anything less than $2
- spend more than 20 min per day on crosswords (functionally, this means don't attempt crosswords after Thursday)
- online shopping shopping should be specific, not browsing
- drink alcohol alone

and not just functional- these are reflective of priorities/ passions as a whole
