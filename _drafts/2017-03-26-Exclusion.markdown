when i took the bible as literature in my senior year at yale, professor leslie brisman had a list of what he considered to be "nasty concepts". One of these was the concept of religious exclusivity, that is, exclusion based ethnic grouping (eg the tribes of israelites vs pagans) and religious practice and ideology (monotheism, Abrahamic/Mosaic law). the problem of exclusion is an extremely common objection to christianity and religion in general. after all, almost all religions have some degree of exclusivity to them. indeed if they didn't, their power to dictate and express preference would be gone (fix this).

being in central asia (muslim %), and an employee of UCA, which is an AKDN agency (founded by the Ismaili imam, though it's a secular organization with secular missions), its been interesting to be around faith communities that are very different from my own (ie Christian). becuase UCA is really committed to maintaining its status as a secular university ( it's wayyy more secular than Yale, which is considered by many as "ultra-liberal" ) and because the students and staff at UCA are generally awesome, i'm grateful that i have never ever felt exclusion.

but rather, it's made me think about the concept of Christian exclusion. if as a christian that professes to believe in christian scripture, it's impossible to ignore verses like this: "i am the way, the truth, and the life. no one comes to the father except through me"

What even does it mean to be "saved"? is being saved a matter of the degree to which one experiences fullness and joy in God? it's common for people to think a  perhaps that's a better paradigm than the classic damned to hell/ saved and in heaven binary.

i do not envy the person/entity that needs to reconcile mercy and justice.

in what sense is exclusivism what we think it means?? i can only hope that a god of infinite love and mercy is capable of resolving what appears to be mutual exclusivity according to my weak human logic.

justice and mercy; what an interesting pair of concepts. for now, the best i can do is to meditate on this thought from Micah 6:8 -- " He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good;
and what doth the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?"
