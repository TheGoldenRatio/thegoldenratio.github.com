### Strategy and innovation consultant
I'm currently a consultant at [New Markets Advisors](newmarketsadvisors.com) in Boston, a management consulting firm specializing in innovation, strategy, and the Jobs to Be Done framework. Day-to-day involves primary and secondary research (quantitative and qualitative) and building business strategy and innovation recommendations. Some of the industries I've been working in: financial services & fintech, pharma, healthcare, tech, and education. Clients range from the Fortune 100 to midsize companies.

Here's a [quiz app](https://jobstobedone.herokuapp.com) that I built, where you can learn more about the Jobs to be Done framework, which helps organizations successfully innovate by identifying fundamental customer needs.

### [University of Central Asia](http://ucentralasia.org) (July 2016 -)
I was part of the team that opened UCA’s Naryn campus in its inaugural year! I was responsible for planning co-curricular activities, student life events (athletics and clubs), academic advising, residential life, and mentorship.

I also taught computer programming with weekly lessons on Python and web development in Flask, Bootstrap, Jekyll. I created an institutional research report with D3 visualizations based on admissions data, classroom data, running and analyzing surveys regarding student campus life and academics in order to inform decisions on admissions, facilities, and student services.

Here's a cool
