<img src="/images/american gothic.jpg" width="381" height="449">

I'm Jonathan Chang, currently a junior at Yale Univerity. I'm double major in political science and mechanical engineering. I'm interested in international politics and development, in addition to everything else in the world. I love traveling, the color orange, and pretty things.


This website is still a work in progress. It was created with [Jekyll][2], a Ruby static site generator. It has free hosting (via [Github][1]). Check out the site to learn more and set up your own Jekyll blog. You don’t need to have too much technical knowledge—just a  very basic understanding of HTML, Ruby, Github, and most importantly, Google search.
