<h2>About this blog</h2>

This website is still a work in progress. It was created with [Jekyll][2], a Ruby static site generator. It has free hosting (via [Github][1]) and is kind of fun. Check out the site to learn more and set up your own Jekyll blog. You don’t need to have too much technical knowledge—just a  very basic understanding of HTML, Ruby, Github, and most importantly, Google search.
