### A bit of myself:

- I'm currently a **product manager** at an **AI startup**. We're using **natural language generation** and large datasets to automate news publishing
- I was a consultant at a leading **strategy / innovation consulting** firm in Boston
- I was a part of the **start-up team** for the **University of Central Asia** in Kyrgyzstan. It was the first fully residential, liberal arts university in the region
- I graduated cum laude from **Yale University** in 2016. I double majored in **political science** and **mechanical engineering**


### My interests:

- data visualization and design
- statistics, machine learning, natural language processing
- tech, entrepreneurship, and education for international development

### For fun, I like to: 

- solve the New York Times Crossword
- watch and critique film
- travel, write, make videos
- read

### Building this blog:

This blog has been a work in progress (the first commit was over *5* years ago!) and was created with Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator. I highly recommend it!

### Finally, a disclaimer:

I've heard people say that social media serves as a reflection for our current (and often aspirational) conceptions of self. I think that writing and blogging (esp. about yourself) has a similar function. This blog is just a collection of random thoughts and updates on my life. I really like extended inside jokes (particularly those pertaining to [The Consortium](http://consortium.pw), so if anything doesn't make sense you can just ask me about it.
