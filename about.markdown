# About me

### A bit about me

Hi, I'm Jonathan Chang! I'm currently a consultant at a leading **strategy and innovation consulting** firm in Boston. But I'm in the process of transitioning away from consulting towards doing more **data science and engineering**. I love wading through data and I want to combine my **analytical skills**, **programming chops**, and **business acumen**. My goal is to work with organizations that create amazing solutions to address the world's most pressing issues.

I graduated **cum laude from Yale University** in 2016, where I double majored in **political science** and **mechanical engineering**. My senior political science thesis was a global comparitive analysis of state **pension/welfare system typologies**, with an emphasis on China. My senior design project was creating a prototype of a low cost, networked **air quality monitor for the US EPA**, in order to create a high resolution, real-time air pollution map for the city of Baltimore.

After graduation, I lived in **Kyrgyzstan** for one year, which honestly has been one of the most enjoyable and meaningful things I've done in my (so far, short) life. I was a part of the start-up team for the **University of Central Asia**, the first fully residential, liberal arts university in the region. It was an amazing institution and experience.

### My interests

 I have a lot of interests including:
- data visualization and analytics
- statistics, machine learning, natural language processing
- technologies, entrepreneurship, and education for developing contexts

For fun, I like to:
- solve the New York Times Crossword (sadly, can only constently solve up to Thursdays)
- watch and critique film (def *not* a snob and can I tell you about MoviePass??)
- travel, write, and make videos

### Building this blog

This blog has been a work in progress (the first commit was *5* years ago!) and was created with Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator. I highly recommend it!

### Finally, a disclaimer

I've heard people say that social media serves as a reflection for our current (and often aspirational) conceptions of self. I think that writing and blogging (esp. about yourself) has a similar function. This blog is just a collection of random thoughts and updates on my life. I really like extended inside jokes (particularly those pertaining to [The Consortium](http://consortium.pw), so if anything doesn't make sense you can just ask me about it.
