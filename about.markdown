<img src="/images/slackline.jpg" alt="color photo ftl" /> 

I'm 18 years old. I was born in New Jersey, moved to California, moved to Utah, and now spend most of my time in Connecticut.

I love traveling, hiking, reading, music, exploring, and doing the previously mentioned things simultaneously. Learning and trying new things is the best thing ever.

Oh, and my favorite color is orange.
