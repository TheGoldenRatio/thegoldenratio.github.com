<h2>About this blog </h2>

<h3> First and foremost, a disclaimer. </h3>

This blog is for me. It's a place to put down my thoughts. Things that bother me, things that don't, and things that are genuinely interesting to me. After its personal utility, this blog is also for my closest friends at Yale. If you are neither me nor a close friend, still feel free to look around but just know that some things will make no sense.

<h3> A bit about me.</h3>
I'm Jonathan Chang, a senior at Yale Univerity. I'm a double major in political science and mechanical engineering because I'm interested in anything and everything and indecisive. I'm interested in international politics and development, entrepreneurship, data, and design. I love traveling, art, the color orange, Carleen, museums, reading books, UCW, my suitemates, and the Consortium.

<h3> Building this blog.</h3>
This blog is a work in progress. It was created with [Jekyll][2], a Ruby static site generator. It is freely hosted (via [Github][1]). Check out the site to learn more and set up your own Jekyll blog. You don’t need to have too much technical knowledge—just a  very basic understanding of HTML, Ruby, Github, and most importantly, Google search.
