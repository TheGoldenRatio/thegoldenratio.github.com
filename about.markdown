# About this blog

### First and foremost, a disclaimer.  
I've heard people say that social media serves as a reflection for our current (and often aspirational) conceptions of self. I think that writing and blogging (esp. about yourself) has a similar function. As such, this blog will constantly evolve as I think of weird things to post and then cringe later on. The probability is high that many things will make no sense because I enjoy extremely extended, convoluted inside jokes. I realize that some people do not. Sorry.

### A bit about me.
I'm Jonathan Chang, a recent Yale University grad (HC/FFKACC '16). I was a double major in political science and mechanical engineering because I'm interested in everything and often pretty indecisive. I'm currently into international politics and development, entrepreneurship, data, and design. I love art, Carleen, the [Consortium][1], crosswords, good infographics, museums, orange(s), pretending to be a weightlifter, reading, my suitemates, traveling, UCA people, and UCW, in alphabetical order.

I'm currently living in Kyrgyzstan which honestly has been one of the most enjoyable and meaningful things I've done in my (so far, short) life. 10/10 would recommend just moving to a place you know nothing about if the chance ever comes up.

### Building this blog.
This blog is a work in progress and was created with [Jekyll][2], a Ruby static site generator. I highly recommend it cause it's pretty simple and freely hosted on Github.
