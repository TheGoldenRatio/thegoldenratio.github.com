<h2>About this blog</h2>
<img src="/images/american gothic.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto">

I'm Jonathan Chang, currently a junior at Yale Univerity. I'm a double major in political science and mechanical engineering and interested in international politics and development. I love traveling, art, the color orange, museums, reading books, UCW, my suitemates, listening to music, tart fruit, Kanye West, meeting new people, baseball players named Chris Lanham, perfectly designed blogs, John Donne, and Gothic Revivalism.


This blog is a work in progress. Art in progress. It was created with [Jekyll][2], a Ruby static site generator. It has free hosting (via [Github][1]). Check out the site to learn more and set up your own Jekyll blog. You don’t need to have too much technical knowledge—just a  very basic understanding of HTML, Ruby, Github, and most importantly, Google search.
