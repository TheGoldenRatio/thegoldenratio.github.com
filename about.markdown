### A bit about myself:

- I'm currently a consultant at a leading **strategy and innovation consulting** firm in Boston
- I'm transitioning to **data science and engineering**. I love wading through data and I want to combine my **analytical skills**, **programming chops**, and **business acumen**
- I graduated **cum laude from Yale University** in 2016 where I double majored in **political science** and **mechanical engineering**
- After graduation, I lived in **Kyrgyzstan** for one year, which honestly has been one of the most enjoyable and meaningful things I've done in my (so far, short) life
- While in Kyrgyzstan, I was a part of the **start-up team** for the **University of Central Asia**, the first fully residential, liberal arts university in the region. It was an amazing institution and experience.

### My interests:

- data visualization and analytics
- statistics, machine learning, natural language processing
- technologies, entrepreneurship, and education for developing contexts

### For fun, I like to: 

- solve the New York Times Crossword
- watch and critique film
- travel, write, make videos
- read a lot

### Building this blog:

This blog has been a work in progress (the first commit was *5* years ago!) and was created with Jekyll, a Ruby static site generator. I highly recommend it!

### Finally, a disclaimer:

I've heard people say that social media serves as a reflection for our current (and often aspirational) conceptions of self. I think that writing and blogging (esp. about yourself) has a similar function. This blog is just a collection of random thoughts and updates on my life. I really like extended inside jokes (particularly those pertaining to [The Consortium](http://consortium.pw), so if anything doesn't make sense you can just ask me about it.
