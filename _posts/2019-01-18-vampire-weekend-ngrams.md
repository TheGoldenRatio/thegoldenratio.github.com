> Vampire Weekend ngrams list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HdqJJQBn1fGwImIUEHEtY_gCyfEOCSddj9OZ_4l9Zk/edit?usp=sharing)

I'm pissed. Vampire Weekend is one of my favorite bands and so when they released the initials of the their new album -- *FOTB* -- I wanted to guess it.

I generated a list of potential Vampire Weekend album names on Jan. 17, by using a list of [4-grams](http://www.ngrams.info ) and then searching for the first letters that matched FOTB (easy task with programming). But then I didn't publish it. Cause if we looked at their past titles, there's no way they would actually use a common phrase right (*Vampire Weekend*, *Contra*, *Modern Vampires of the City*)? Which totally invalidated my ngram strategy, I thought.

But guess what? **I actually guessed it. FATHER. OF. THE. BRIDE.**  *Father of the bride? Father of the briideee???* Can you believe that they used such a common phrase? And that "OF" and "THE" were two of the words? That's so lazy.

Since I didn't document my work before the announcement, it basically doesn't count though. Imagine if I had tweeted @arzE... That sweet, sweet 15 minutes of fame...

Anyway, here's that [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_HdqJJQBn1fGwImIUEHEtY_gCyfEOCSddj9OZ_4l9Zk/edit?usp=sharing) of 4-grams I generated. Still angry.
