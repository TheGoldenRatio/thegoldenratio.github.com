I tried writing something serious. Then I realized that, damn, this isn’t working. <br>

Writing seriously is a vulnerable act made in faith. I was working on a serious piece yesterday. But every other time I read it, I was left with a grapefruit-level bitterness in my mouth. I couldn’t get over the fact that I could sound so self-absorbed, self-aggrandizing, even self-righteous. It practically begged to be mocked. And I’d rather not embarrass myself.
