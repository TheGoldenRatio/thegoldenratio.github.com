The drive to Ithaca was indeed a long one. On October 6, I left work early so I could drive to Ithaca with a childhood friend (Sam) to visit Anderson at Cornell. It also happened to be the Columbus Day weekend so after picking up the car from the airport, I tried to get to BU's hospital in South End as soon as possible to pick Samuel up. Apparently 2 PM wasn't early enough and we were in stop and go traffic for several hours. Thankfully Sam drove because I soon felt sleepy, but not so sleepy as to prevent me from appreciating the early October foliage.

Half way through the drive, we took a stop in Albany and Rensselaer. I admired the Empire State plaza, 4 sparsely spaced towers and the Egg, probably one of the most unique set of government buildings I've ever seen.[^1] At a Indian / Pakistani restaurant in downtown Albany, I ate biryani for dinner, a pleasant reminder of Chef Omer and Sherbaz.

By the time we arrived at the lovely Chesterton House nearly 8 hours later, it was dark. But not so late that Anderson and his friends couldn't take us on a night hike by the falls. There was swimming in a lake (them, not me).

Anderson had a full schedule for us the following day. We met an enthusiastic freshman tailgater and ate lunch. We then saw many large mansions converted into Greek houses, smelled the sheep and cows on the farm, heard a crowd cheer as Cornell football team beat Harvard (I'm ok with that). At the Ag school I shared a delicious, very rich pint of blackberry, caramel, Bavarian raspberry, and pumpkin (my favorite) ice cream with Anderson. Afternoon napped before going grocery shopping so that Anderson and Sam could cook a Thai curry dinner for us and a group of friends.

Sunday started early and Anderson took us to his Anglican church, a cute place in Ithaca with liturgy and dark wood wall-paneling. I skipped the Eucharist because sharing the cup seemed like an unnecessary health hazard. But a baby was baptized with water sprinkled onto her head with a seashell and they celebrated with wine(!), very tasty cupcakes, brownies, and coffee so I got my own Communion after all.

Before I left, Anderson cut my hair in the basement of the house, next to the ping-pong table and a ratty looking couch. The last time he cut my hair two years ago, we got into a huge argument. I think we both swore that no haircuts would ever happen between us again. Time seemed to have healed that particular row, just as it had other prior divisions.

All in all, a quality fall trip reconnecting with two important people that I've known for a long time.
