We are a collective of individuals, an eccentric body of intellectuals, a consortium of the greatest minds ever assembled. Our interests span legions, and yet we are bound by a singular burden to beauty and truth.

The "pw" stands for Palau. For the geographically inclined, it's an island country located in the western Pacific Ocean with a population of around 21,000 spread across 250 islands, which form the western chain of the Caroline Islands in Micronesia.

We think it might be a tax haven. But it's got a booming online tech scene.
