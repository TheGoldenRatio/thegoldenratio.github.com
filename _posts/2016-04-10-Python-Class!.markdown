This weekend [Mike](mikewuis.me), [Kevin](ktizzel.com), and I taught a Python class for Y Hack's [Code Boola](http://codeboola.yhack.org/), an event that helps high school kids around the New Haven area learn how to code. Below is the slide deck. We also created a test script with several coding challenges for them to complete.

It's pretty amazing how much some of them already knew. I'm pleased to announce that some of the kids were definitely better than me. One guy finished all 31 of our challenges in just over an hour. I'm pretty sure I couldn't do that. Mike confirmed that I could not do that.
