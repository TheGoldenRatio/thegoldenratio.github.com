[This](../d3/net.html) is an incomplete social network visualization of the admitted students of the UCA class of 2021.  

I'm currently experimenting with how to display d3 in markdown. I can't figure out how to embed it directly yet so my temporary, unideal workaround is to just use links.

d3 is pretty sweet and I want to keep on working on building cooler visualizations. Thanks, [Mike](http://mikewuis.me) for telling me about it.
