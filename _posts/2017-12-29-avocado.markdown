I have a green thumb. In early November, I stuck 3 toothpicks into an avocado pit generously provided by my coworker, Brock. He was going through an avocado toast phase which meant that he had a leftover avocado seed every day for about 10 days straight.

I hate to see things go to waste. There was so much potential in those seeds. And the office desperately needed some greenery. Hence, toothpicks.

It took over 6 weeks and to be honest there were times when I was starting to lose faith. But once the cracks started forming and the bottom split open, it was clear that this avocado seed would become a tree soon enough.

I was going to do a cool time-lapse thing but I stopped after 3 days. Here's an attempt though. I've never made a gif before.
