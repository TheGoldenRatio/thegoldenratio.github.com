There are a whole lot of Jonathan Changs in this world. [Google][1] it-- on the date of this post (6/13/13) this website doesn't show up until the 7th page.

To be fair, my parents could have given me a more obscure name. [Jonathan][2] happened to be the 35th most popular name in the US in 2012. [Chang][3] is also the one of the most common surnames in the world. It is the 4th most popular surname in Taiwan and 3rd most popular in China. I share the same last name with about *90 million* people.

As you may have noticed, the title of this post is "Goals." Given that there are so many of us, it shouldn't come as a surprise that there are some pretty amazing Jonathan Changs. With that in mind, these are what my goals **aren't**:
	
	1. Show up as the first Google search result.
	2. Be the Jonathan Chang with the most dominant social media 
	   presence on the internet.
	3. Become the most "successful" Jonathan Chang ever.
	
I believe in dreaming big. But setting unrealistic goals and constantly comparing yourself with others is pretty uncool. It's quite vain and offputting. I hope to avoid that so here are my **actual** goals (as of now):

	1. Produce high quality content that is meaningful, interesting, 
	   and refreshing for readers.
	2. Grow and maintain the readership of this site.
	3. Learn to use the internet as a tool to create a positive 
	   impact in the world.

These goals are subject to change. Indeed, I hope to update them as the focus of this site becomes more apparent. But for now, I hope to keep the general concepts in mind in order to maintain the right perspective and approach. Expect some good stuff in the following weeks (and months and years).
