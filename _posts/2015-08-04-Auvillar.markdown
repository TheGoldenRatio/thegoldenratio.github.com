*Auvillar, overlook into the Garonne Valley*

I am currently taking a writing class in Auvillar, France. I've been here for a little more than 2 weeks already. Auvillar is a small village in the Midi-Pyrenees region in southwest France. The closest city is the Toulouse, which is about an hour away by car. The sun shines 16 hours a day and it is quite possibly the most comfortable (and safe?) place in the world.

I am learning about travel writing. It's an interesting genre because while the name suggests that it should be about travel, it is only sometimes or somewhat related to travel. Mostly, it's about yourself. I'm starting to learn that most writing is basically about yourself and that I'm not entirely comfortable about that and definitely not good at that.

This is, however, an AMAZING opportunity to work on my writing and learn from others who are great writers. Thus, I will post the writing that I have done in the past couple weeks.

Friends, I hope you enjoy the work that I'll be putting up. We can discuss this when I'm back in the states. Which will be pretty soon (about a month).

Best,
Jonathan
