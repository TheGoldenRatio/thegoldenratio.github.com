Look, <i>i</i> like Kendrick Lamar and all... but Kanye West had one of the best rap songs of all time. Of all time.

Maybe you think that's an exaggeration. I respect your opinion because we're each entitled that. But this statement is not really all that controversial: BOUND 2 WAS CLEARLY THE BEST NOMINATED RAP SONG OF 2014.

<i>good kid, m.A.A.D city</i> was indisputably the best rap album of 2013. It was phenomenal and should have won Best Rap Album. Heck, Kendrick should have won <i>several</i> Grammys (7 nominations, no win? That's some [True Grit][1] bs right there).  

But I would hesitate to put <i>i</i> in the same category. It was good. Just not phenomenal.

The Grammy Award committee had to make up for their terrible decisions in their 56th iteration. I get that. But I wish the committee didn't have to take it out on one of the most beautiful rap songs of 2013/2014.

I was disappointed initially. To be fair though, Yeezy probably doesn't really care.
